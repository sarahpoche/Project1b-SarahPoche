                    <p>Sarah Poch√© is a 21 year old singer/songwriter based in New Orleans, LA with the hopes of becoming a recording artist. She draws both her musical and writing influences from several different artists from the Rolling Stones to Taylor Swift but mainly focuses her writing in the pop and country genres. After showing an interest in music at a young age she has since been writing for almost a decade and performing for just as long. Right now, Sarah is currently writing for new and upcoming projects. </p>
